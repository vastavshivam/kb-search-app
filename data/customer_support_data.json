The issue is now resolved, and the customer can log in to their Microsoft console. I also guided them on domain configuration and cleared their doubts. However, while adding the domain, an error occurred stating that the domain is already added to a different Microsoft account. According to the customer, they never added it before. Therefore, we are raising a ticket with Microsoft to remove it from the backend."
